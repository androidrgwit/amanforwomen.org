A Man for Women foundation believes that a world where any man exercises self-control to prevent violence against women is a better world. We also believe that increasing awareness in potential parents about reproductive health and the long-lasting impacts of having a baby is a priority for any fair society. Therefore, we propose two topics for discussion.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. "How to reduce violence against women"</li>
    <li>2. "When and how should I become a father"</li>
</ul>
                    <p>We do not have the answers; we just invite you to look for them.<br>  
                    In case you want some suggestions to start thinking, here you go:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are there violent actions against women around me? When do I think something is violence? Why does it happen?</li>
                        <li>Are there any situations at home, within the family, or at work that may increase the risk of violence?</li>
                        <li>Which behaviors would help reduce violent acts such as rape, verbal harassment and aggression, touching in public space, or domestic violence?</li>
                        <li>What is my view of a relationship? What conducts are unhealthy in a relationship?</li>

                        <li>How, in my opinion, does a good father behave? Which examples from my father will I take and what will I do better than men around me?</li>
                        <li>How does a good father behave with children and with the mother of his children?</li>
                        <li>When will it be the right moment for me to become a father?</li>
                        <li>How might the relationship with my partner change after having children?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    You can look for videos and inspiration on the web. Some organisations that tackle these issues are UNFPA, PROMUNDO, Men Speak Out. Evidence of the sad reality of violence against women are all around us. We can be astonished while reading the news, and examples in popular culture such as Lady Gaga with "Till it happens to you" or No Te Va a Gustar with "Nunca más a mi lado" are appealing invitations to act, as is the Beyonce song "I was here".
