                    <p>We invite you to think and then to DEBATE with your peers.
A Man for Women foundation encourages men and women to involve men in discussions of ways to reduce violence against women, to understand why violence against women occurs, and to understand why it is bad for both men and women. We also invite people to discuss why being a responsible father is an important way of making the world a better place.</p>
<p>
If you are a teacher who wishes to participate we will send a certificate of participation to your school mentioning both the school and the teacher. If you are a student, we will send you a certificate and, if you want, also one to the teacher who hosted the discussions.</p>
<p>
Some suggestions to launch the discussion:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make a presentation, 
                            <li>Organise a debate in the school, and make a presentation to launch the discussion or a few introductory remarks</li>
                            <li>Involve male members of sports teams in the discussions</li>
                            <li>Invite people to share their experiences</li>
                            <li>Invite roles models, invite men that the teenagers admire, invite men who fight violence</li>
                            <li>Invite men committed as parents to share their experience</li>
                            <li>Invite members of a family that suffered abuse</li>
                            <li>Consider whether men will be more active and sincere by having "men only" discussions, or by having an older man or an admired man as an example</li>
                            <li>Consider the social rules and the gender roles in the place where you live, and lead the discussion in a constructive way, respecting all religious beliefs and different cultural and political opinions.</li>
                        </ul>
